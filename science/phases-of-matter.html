<h2>States/Phases of matter</h2>

<p>Look around you. What do you see? The odds that almost everything you saw is matter are very high. <br />
You might already know that matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. It is what you are made of, it is what the universe is made of. <br />
Matter can exist in four phases/states namely solid, liquid, gas and plasma.</p>

<h3>Solids</h3>A mobile phone, a pencil, a silver coin and a piece of paper are all examples of solids. Solids consitute of tiny particles that are closely packed together and they cannot flow or move around, all they do is vibrate at a fixed position. <br />Solids are very important in our lives. Imagine there were no Solids on earth. Where could you even be standing, sitting  at the moment?! <br />
All solids share the following properties.
<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Definite shape</li>
<li>&#x2714;Definite volume</li>
</ol>

<h3>Liquids</h3>
<p>Although particles in a liquid are close together, they are not held tight as are the particles in a solid. The particles are free to move and that's why liquids are able to flow. Some of them however do not flow easily. We say they have high viscosity. Viscosity is the resistance to flow by a liquid. Water has a lower viscosity compared to honey.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Liquids have a definite volume</li>
<li>&#x2714;Liquids do not have a definite shape, they take the shape of the container.</li>
</ol>

Water (Propably the most common liquid on Earth), oil, ethanol are all examples of liquids.

<h3>Gases</h3>
<p>Gases have their particles far apart from one another and are free to move around. They therefore spread out to fill all the available space in a container. Infact, they can expand without limit if allowed to. Gas particles can also be pushed close together. </p>
<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Gases  have no definite shape</li>
<li>&#x2714;They have no definite volume they can occupy less volume when compressed or more under low pressure.</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Plasma</h3>

<p>Plasma is the fourth state in  which matter does exist. It is the most common in the universe even though it's rare on Earth. The Sun for instance contains matter in the plasma state. Matter in the Plasma state is extremely high in energy and therefore dangerous to living things. </p>
<br />
<p>The above four phases are the already known states. Maybe Scientists might discover a new one considering the trends in new discoveries.</p>

<p>You can also change from one state to the other under certain conditions, majorly by playing around with the temperature. I bet you have heard of melting and boiling points. Melting point for instance is the point at which a solid turns to a liquid. The following are the main state changes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Solid to liquid -Melting </li>
<li>Liquid to solid -Freezing </li>
<li>Liquid to gas -Evaporation/vaporation</li>
<li>Gas to liquid -Condensation </li>
<li>Solid to gas -Sublimation </li>
<li>Gas to Solid -Deposition </li>
</ol>
