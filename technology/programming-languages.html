<h2>Popular Programming languages</h2>


<p>This article is going to give you an overview of the most popular programming languages and some of their main applications in the Computer software industry. <br /> </p>
<p>A programming language is used to give instructions to a computer, as you might already know. There are and have been hundreds of programming languages, some of them popular, others you've never heard of. We are going to focus on the most popular at the present and how they can be used. Some languages have already established themselves in a certain field while others are generally more preferred. Read on to know about them. <br /></p>
<p>
We have not included HTML and CSS as they are not programming languages. They are however very vital for client side web development.</p>


<p class="w3-light-blue">Most programming languages are general programming languages and can be used in many areas. However there are the areas in which they are mostly used, and those are the areas we have mentioned. </p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages used in a variety of fields. Many people like it because it's easy to learn or rather it has a less steep learning curve as compared to other programming languages. It is majorly used in;</p>
<ol>

<li>&#x2714;Machine Learning -Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn are used.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Data Science -closely related to machine learning, numpy, matplotlib and pandas are also used.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Server Side Scripting. This is mainly through Django</li>
<li>&#x2714;Development of Desktop Graphical User Interface;</li>
<li>&#x2714;Development of Games using Pygame library</li>
<li>&#x2714;Image processing</li>
<li>&#x2714;Computer vision</li>
</ol>

<h3>Javascript/ ECMAScript</h3>
<p>Javascript is a programming language which has already established itself in front end web development. 95% of websites use Javascript on the client side. Javascript is almost a must know for any front end web developer nowadays, though some developers might just use a Javascript library such as Jquery. It's main use is on;</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Front end web development/ Client side scripting. Simplified and made powerful by libraries such as Jquery, React, Angular and Vue.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Back end development. This is made possible by using Nodejs (A Javascript runtime environment)</li>
<li>&#x2714;App development. Mostly on conjunction with HTML and CSS with softwares such as Apache Cordova.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Game Development mostly in conjunction with HTML and CSS</li>
</ol>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is another popular programming language. <q>Write once run everywhere</q> (WORA) is it's principle. It is majorly used in;</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Android App Development The Android Studio and Java Development kit (JDK) are the main softwares used.</li>

<li>&#x2714;Server Side scripting mainly by use of Java Server Pages (JSP). Java applets can also be downloaded to bring a functionality initially not there to browsers</li>
</ol>

<h3>PHP (Hypertext PreProcessor)</h3>
<p>Originally known as Personal Home Page, PHP is one of the most used programming language in Back end  web development (It's main strength). It currently powers over 80% of the websites on the web on the Back end. It is mostly recommended for beginners in Back end development. PHP is facing lots of competition from other back end languages lately, specifically Javascript using Nodejs and Python Django. Content management Systems such as Wordpress are however ensuring it's continuity.  <br />
Main Applications;</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Back end web development. <b>Laravel</b> library is the most popular by far.</li>

<li>&#x2714;App Development. This is especially apps that need updates from the server. Basically still Back end development.</li>
</ol>

<h3>C </h3>
<p>Though old, C is still one of the most popular programming languages to date. It has influenced most of the other programming languages you know of. C is closely related to how machines work making it suitable for developing low level applications. C has wide fields of applications including;</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Embedded Systems</li> <li>&#x2714;Systems Programming</li>
<li>&#x2714;Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>&#x2714;Industrial Automation</li>
<li>&#x2714;Computer Graphics</li>
<li>&#x2714;Space Research</li>
<li>&#x2714;Image Processing</li>
<li>&#x2714;Game Programming</li>
</ol>

<h3>C#</h3>
<p>Pronounced as 'C-Sharp', it is a programming language developed by Microsoft as part of it's .NET framework. C# is mainly used for the following purposes. </p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Microsoft app development -this includes Windows(both laptops and phones)</li>
<li>&#x2714;Cross platform app development using the Xamarin framework.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Game Development using Unity game engine -Most preferred language for games</li>
<li>&#x2714;Server Side programming</li>
<li>&#x2714;Virtual reality</li>
</ol>

<h3>Swift</h3>

<p>Swift was developed by Apple for developing softwares for their products such as IOS, MacOS, tvOS, watchOS and more. Swift is replacing Objective-C which was being used for the same. Basically, swift is used for;</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Developing Applications for IOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS.</li>

</ol>
<p>If you are into developing mobile apps for Iphone and desktop apps for MacOS, swift will be your option. Being introduced in 2014 also means there are fairly few swift developers and therefore high demand for them in return.</p>

<h3>C++</h3>

<p>C++ is an extension to the C programming language. It takes C capabilities  to another level while keeping it simple. C++ is majorly used for low level system applications. Major uses are on;</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;System/ Application software</li>
<li>&#x2714;Embedded firmware</li>
<li>&#x2714;Drivers programming</li>
<li>&#x2714;Server side programming</li>
</ol>

<h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>

<p>SQL is a database query language. It is used to 'play' around with data on a database usually using some logic from another programming language. If you intend to become a back end web developer, fullstack developer or a data scientist, SQL might not be evadable. It is basically used for; </p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714; Creating databases, reading data from a database, updating data and deleting data from databases.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>Ruby is a scripting language majorly used for web development. It has a reputation for being easy to learn and still powerful. The main case use is;</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Back end development using the Ruby on Rails or simply Rails framework.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Kotlin is a programming language that is getting more popular over the past  years. It is now the preferred language by Google for Android app development. It also blends well with Java. It is generally used for.</p>

<ol>
<li>&#x2714;Mobile app development (especially Android)</li>
<li>&#x2714;Front end web development majorly through kotlin.js </li>

<li>&#x2714;Server Side programming</li>
<li>&#x2714;Data Science</li>
</ol>

<h3>R programming language</h3>
<p>R is a programming language used extensively in data science. It is known for being difficult to learn (steep learning curve). It's however powerful when it comes to data science. I would not advice any beginner in programming to start with R, (my opinion though). R is basically used in;
<ol>

<li>&#x2714;Statistical computations and analysis -basically Data Science</li>
</ol>

<h3>Objective-C</h3>

<p>Objective-C is a language used to create applications for Apple products such as IOS and MacOS. Though it is bound to fall in popularity due to introduction of Swift (the preffered language by Apple for their OS') in 2014, it is still very popular. Many of the applications on the Applestore today were written in Objective-C and more are still being written using Objective-C. It is mainly used for; </p>

<ol>

<li>&#x2714;Application development (especially IOS and MacOS)</li>
