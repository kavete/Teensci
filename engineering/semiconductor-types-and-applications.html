<h1>Semiconductor types and applications</h1>

<p>A semiconductor is a solid-state substance that portrays a class of crystalline solids and that has its electrical conductivity falling in between that of conductors and insulators. This feature of intermediate electrical conductivity has resulted to the massive employment of semiconductors in the manufacture of multiple kinds of electronic devices such as solid-state transistors, diodes, integrated circuits etc. Semiconductors are majorly made from elements or compounds that exhibit a unique property in their electron structure such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), gallium arsenide (GaAS).</p>

<h2>Types of semiconductors</h2>

<p>Semiconductors can be classified in to two broad categories, -that is Intrinsic and Extrinsic semiconductors. Intrinsic semiconductors are those that are composed of only one kind of material, silicon and germanium are two common examples of intrinsic semiconductors. They are also referred to as undoped or ‘I-type’ semiconductors. While extrinsic semiconductors are intrinsic semiconductors that have some substances added to them to alter their properties, a process referred to as <b>DOPING</b>.</p>

<h3>Intrinsic semiconductors</h3>

<p>As discussed above, an intrinsic semiconductor also referred to as undoped or i-type semiconductor is a pure semiconductor in which no significant dopant components or impurities have been added. With there being no addition of impurities (doping), the number of charge carriers is therefore determined by the properties of the material/element itself. The number of holes and excited electrons are equal n=p. At times, this remains the case even after addition of impurities to the semiconductor, only when doped with donors and acceptors equally.
</p>

<h3>Extrinsic semiconductors</h3>

<p>An extrinsic semiconductor is basically one that has been doped, that is, during manufacture a chemical referred to as a doping agent is incorporated chemically in to the semiconductor. This process of incorporating the semiconductor with the doping agent is basically done in order to give it different electrical properties than the pure semiconductor. The foreign atoms induced to semiconductor during doping becomes the charge carriers which transmit electric current through the crystal. During doping, two different agents are used resulting to two different types of extrinsic semiconductors i.e. n-type and p-type semiconductors.
n-type semiconductor is one that is created when the semiconductor is doped with electron donor atoms because majority of charge carriers in the crystal are negative electrons.
p-type semiconductor is one which has been doped with electron acceptor atoms. The majority of charge carriers in p-type crystal are positive holes.
</p>

<h4>The following is a list of some critical Semiconductor features</h4>

<ul>
<li>&#x2714;Interestingly semiconductors act as insulators at absolute zero, and at high temperatures they tend to act like conductors.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Due to their small size, they possess less weight and this feature has resulted to their intense use in small electrical gadgets such as digital watches.</li>

<li>&#x2714;Semiconductors have higher resistivity than conductors but less resistivity than insulators.</li>
<li>&#x2714;With increase in temperatures, the internal resistance of semiconductors simultaneously increases and also decreases with decrease in temperature, this is because changes in temperature affect the internal structure of the semiconductors.</li>
<li>&#x2714;Semiconductors are attributed to less power loss</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of Semiconductors</h2>

<p>Due to the fact that we can control the flow of electrons in semiconductors, they’ve been largely used in electrical circuits.</p>
<p>
Semiconductors have played a key role in the manufacture of transistors and many other electronic devices. These devices are made from semiconductor materials that conduct electric current under certain environments.</p>
<p>Manufacture of <b>integrated circuits;</b> integrated circuits or ICs consists of multiple transistors on a silicon chip.</p>
<p>
Manufacture of <b>semiconductor lasers;</b> when illuminated, some semiconductors respond by producing an electric current (photovoltaic effect). Due to this feature photovoltaic cells have been used in the provision of electrical power in remote areas, satellites etc.
</p>
<p>
Semiconductors have also been used in the production of <b>diodes</b>, these are some of the simplest semiconductor devices. Diodes are made from silicon, a half having been doped with N-type impurities and the other half doped wit P-type impurities. The primary advantage of diodes is the fact that they allow electric current to flow in only one direction and prevent it from the other direction. Diodes have further been used in production of half-wave rectifier which produce a direct current, full-wave rectifier which converts alternating current to direct current, production of Varactor diode and in manufacture of Photodiode.</p>
